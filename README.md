You are tasked with developing a RESTful API using Node.js for a
food delivery app. How would you structure the API endpoints to
handle high-traffic scenarios like order creation and order status
updates? What considerations would you take into account to ensure
scalability?"
Students should apply Node.js concepts (e.g., routing, API design) to
real-world applications, considering traffic load and scalability.
